# Logo Replacement Note

## ⚠️ Important: Logo Image Needs to be Replaced

The logo image file (`frontend/src/assets/logo.png`) currently contains "Tomato" branding. 

**To fix this:**
1. Replace `frontend/src/assets/logo.png` with your FoodExpress logo
2. The logo should display "FoodExpress" text (as shown in your design)
3. Recommended size: 150px width (or similar aspect ratio)

**After replacing:**
- Push the new logo.png file to GitHub
- Render will automatically rebuild the frontend
- The new logo will appear on your live site

**Note:** All code references have been updated to use "FoodExpress" - only the image file needs replacement.
